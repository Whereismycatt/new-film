<div class="About-Introduction" id="blurb">
    <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven episodes of magical literature by British author J. K. Rowling: Philosopher's Stone (1997), Chamber of Secrets (1998), Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Goblet of Fire (2000), Order of the Phoenix (2003), Half-Blood Prince (2005) and Deathly Hallows (2007).</p>
    <p>The first six of these books depict the life and adventures of the main character Harry Potter during his six years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The seventh book depicts Harry Potter's search for the Horcruxes and the destruction of Voldemort outside the school.</p>
    <p>Translated into 67 languages, the series has sold over 500 million copies of all editions (as of 2008) and ranks among the worldâ€™s best-selling novels. It has since been adapted by Warner Bros into an eight-part film series of the same name, the total value of which is estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media series of all time.</p>
