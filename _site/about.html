<div class="About-Introduction" id="blurb">
    <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven episodes of magical literature by British author J. K. Rowling: Philosopher's Stone (1997), Chamber of Secrets (1998), Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Goblet of Fire (2000), Order of the Phoenix (2003), Half-Blood Prince (2005) and Deathly Hallows (2007).</p>
    <p>The first six of these books depict the life and adventures of the main character Harry Potter during his six years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The seventh book depicts Harry Potter's search for the Horcruxes and the destruction of Voldemort outside the school.</p>
    <p>Translated into 67 languages, the series has sold over 500 million copies of all editions (as of 2008) and ranks among the worldâ€™s best-selling novels. It has since been adapted by Warner Bros into an eight-part film series of the same name, the total value of which is estimated at $25 billion, making Harry Potter one of the highest-grossing media series of all time.</p>
    <p>Our group's web project was originally designed to educate the public and was aimed primarily at film and travel enthusiasts. The film is mainly aimed at Harry Potter and the locations are mainly aimed at the UK.</p>
    <p>Our website is divided into three sections: Home, Archive, About.</p>
    <p>1.Home</p>
    <p>This is the home page of the website and contains a brief introduction to the archive as well as profiles of the authors who wrote the Harry Potter novels and the characters who played the main characters in the Harry Potter films.</p>
    <p>2.Archive</p>
    <p>This is the main content of the website. It shows some of the locations where Harry Potter was filmed in the UK (including London, Oxford, Scotland, etc.) in text and pictures. The textual content briefly describes the historical background of the location and the scenes in which it appears in the film. The images are sourced from Wikipedia and adhere strictly to creative commons.</p>
    <p>3.About</p>
    <p>This section is a general introduction to the site.</p>
    <p>Users can revisit the locations where Harry Potter was filmed based on our website.</p>
