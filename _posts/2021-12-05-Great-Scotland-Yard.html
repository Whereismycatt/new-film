<p>In "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)">[2]</a>, when Harry and Mr. Weasley went to a hearing for using magic in front of Muggles, they entered the Ministry of Magic through a red telephone booth here. In "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)">[3]</a>, Weasley also took Harry through here to enter the Ministry of Magic and attend disciplinary hearings.</p>

<p>The point of entry into the Ministry of Magic is at the junction of Scotland Square and Great Scotland Yard. Unfortunately, the red telephone booth is only a filming prop. If visitors come to sightseeing, they will not see the red telephone booth.</p>

<p>Address: St. James's, Westminster, London, UK</p>
