<p>Harry Potter and Mr. Weasley passed through Westminster underground station when they were on their way to the Ministry of Magic for interrogation. Mr. Weasley was excited to see the "Muggle" turnstile gate in the station, although he met problems using his ticket at the turnstile gate.</p>

<p>The station is located next to London's wonderful sites such as the Big Ben, Houses of Parliament and Downing Street.</p>
