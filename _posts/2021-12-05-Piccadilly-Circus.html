<p>In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (part 1)" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1">[2]</a>, Harry, Ron and Hermione formed an escape trio that flies through London's West End and used apparating to escape from Bill and Fleur's wedding to London's Piccadilly Circus. When they arrived here, they were almost hit by the red bus number 19. To escape the Death Eaters, they ran wildly from here all the way to the soho area.</p>
