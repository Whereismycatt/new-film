<p>St Pancras Railway Station is located between the British Library and Kings Cross Station <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Library">[2]</a>. The station is famous for its architectural structure. It is a north-south rectangle with a Victorian Gothic exterior, which was the largest single-span building at the time <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture">[3]</a>. The whole building is magnificent, magnificent and gorgeous, like a palace and castle. The movie "Spiderman" was also filmed here, and some critics called it "London's most popular" <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">[4]</a>.</p>
 
<p>In the 2000s, this station was expanded and renamed "St. Pancras International Railway Station". The train departs from St. Pancras Station, passes through the Channel Tunnel No. 1 in the south of England, and reaches the European continent. The city rail service for this station and the neighboring King’s Cross station is the King’s Cross St. Pancras Station on the London Underground.</p>

<p>Address: Euston Rd, London N1C 4QL, UK</p>
